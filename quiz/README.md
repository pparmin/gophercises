# Exercise 1: Quiz game

This has been an interesting little exercise. The idea of this exercise is a simple little program, which allows the player to load in a problem set of simple math problems via a .csv file. The player can also set a time limit in which they have to provide solutions to the problems. The program will then go through each problem and prompt the player for their answer. 

This exercise is really great to learn more about the following packages:
