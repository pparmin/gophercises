# Gophercises

This repository is designed to hold all my solutions for Jon Calhoun's excellent learning resource, [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/).

He presents the different exercises first with an introduction video where he describes the problem and gives some hints as to what packages might be useful for implementing the given functionality. He also offers explanation videos which are supposed to show his preferred implementation of each exercise. 

The repository is modelled in accordance with this set-up. It has two branches, one of them holding my solution which I have implemented before watching his video, and a second branch which holds my implementation which has been modified with some of his suggestions (if necessary).
