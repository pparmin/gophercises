# Gophercises

This repository is designed to hold all my solutions for Jon Calhoun's excellent learning resource, [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/).

He presents the different exercises first with an introduction video where he describes the problem and gives some hints as to what packages might be useful for implementing the given functionality. He also offers explanation videos which are supposed to show his preferred implementation of each exercise. 

All solutions have been implemented before watching Jon's solution videos. After watching the solution videos specific improvements are made to reflect his recommendations.
