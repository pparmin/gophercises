# Gophercise 2: Url Shortener

I have to say that I really enjoyed this gophercise. It exposed me to a number of new packages and techniques. Most importantly I really had to dive into configuring custom handlers. In order to do so, it was important to also get a better understanding of how Go uses interfaces. For the normal part of the Gophercise without any extra steps, the data also needed to be encoded, so working with both the yaml and json packages was essential. Additionally, this Gophercise was initially challenging with the folder structure. It required me to understand the process of configuring the .mod file. 
All in all, I had a lot of fun with this one.

For this Gophercise I implemented all extra steps that Jon has mentioned in his description. Especially the extra exercise which included the use of BoltDB was great. BoltDB is a great part of the Go ecosystem and I was happy that I could use it at least briefly in this Gophercise and learn more about it. 

This Gophercise is great to get a better understanding of the following packages:
- [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http)
- [encoding/json](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json)
- [yaml](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/yaml.v2)
- [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt)
